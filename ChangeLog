               CHANGES IN EMC VERSION 1.2



NEW FEATURES

    o   A new parameter called 'nThin' has been added to the functions
        'MetropolisHastings', 'randomWalkMetropolis', 'parallelTempering'
        and 'evolMonteCarlo' that thins the samples by saving every
        'nThin' draw.

        
    o   A new example called 'threeDimNormalFuncGenerator' has been added
        that illustrates the use of the 'block' argument in
        'MHPropNewFunc' and 'logMHPropDensFunc'. This example, and hence
        this package itself now depends on the 'MASS' and the 'graphics'
        libraries.
        

BUG FIXES

    o   The 'startingVals' argument to the functions 'parallelTempering',
        'evolMonteCarlo', 'findMaxTemper' and 'placeTempers' was read
        column by column when it was supposed to be read row by row by the
        underlying C code. Thanks are due to Reza Seirafi
        <rs8fd@cms.mail.virginia.edu> for pointing this bug out.
        

    o   The three functions 'logTarDensFunc', 'MHPropNewFunc' and
        'logMHPropDensFunc' were called by the C code individually, in the
        new version these functions are combined into one function call
        (see '.oneIterMHFuncGen' in file R/common.R). The individual calls
        were creating memory corruption issues in certain platforms (e.g.,
        OS X), since the return value of 'MHPropNewFunc' was not copied by
        the C code to save time.
        
        
        
                CHANGES IN EMC VERSION 1.1

        
NEW FEATURES

    o   The '*FuncGenerator' function listings, which used to live in
        example section of the help pages, making them huge, now live in a
        file called R/funcGenerators.R and the functions therein are
        exported, and they have a help page called 'utilsForExample'.



BUG FIXES

    o   The help pages had a '\' (backslash) character in front of every
        description list, due to an extra '\cr' command, removed those
        occurrences.
