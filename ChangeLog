		CHANGES IN EMC VERSION 1.1

	
NEW FEATURES

    o  	The '*FuncGenerator' function listings, which used to live in
	example section of the help pages, making them huge, now live in a
	file called R/funcGenerators.R and the functions therein are
	exported, and they have a help page called 'utilsForExample'.



BUG FIXES

    o 	The help pages had a '\' (backslash) character in front of every
	description list, due to an extra '\cr' command, removed those
	occurrences.
